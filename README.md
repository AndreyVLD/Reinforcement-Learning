# Reinforcement Learning Project
## Introduction
This repository is a collection of reinforcement learning projects that I have worked on. The projects are implemented in Python using basic Python Libraries. The projects are based on the following algorithms:
- Q-Learning
- SARSA

The aim of the projects is to provide a basic understanding of reinforcement learning algorithms and how they can be implemented in Python. 

## Projects
The problem solved by the algorithm here is the Maze problem. The agent has to navigate through a maze to reach the goal. The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The maze is represented as a grid where the agent can move to the next cell if it is not a wall.

## Requirements
The projects are implemented in Python 3.11. The following libraries are required to run the projects:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tqdm

## Output
The output of the application are 3 graphs:
- The first graph shows the number of steps taken to reach the goal for each episode, on average, for each episode.
- The second graph shows the empty maze.
- The third graph shows the maze with the path taken by the agent to reach the goal.
